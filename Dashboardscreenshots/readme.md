Dashboard overview:

The dashboard offers a rich set of interactive features designed to provide a complete understanding of global weather patterns. The first page gives an overall snapshot through KPIs, world maps, weather condition distributions, and rankings of the hottest and coldest cities, allowing users to quickly grasp global climate variations. The second page focuses on detailed climate metrics, presenting highest and lowest recorded values, maximum wind speeds, and comprehensive country-wise summaries that reveal how environmental conditions differ across regions. The trends page highlights how temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure change over time, supported by powerful slicers that let users filter data by date, country, city, and weather condition for personalized analysis. The deep-dive page offers more advanced visual exploration through comparative charts such as temperature vs. humidity and wind speed vs. pressure, along with country-level breakdowns and a complete tabular dataset view for verifying values. Together, these features make the dashboard highly interactive, informative, and effective for analyzing climate behavior from multiple perspectives.
