ClimateScope – Global Weather Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview:

This Power BI project analyzes global weather patterns across multiple countries and cities using the Global Weather Repository Dataset. The dashboard provides insights into temperature variations, humidity levels, wind speeds, weather conditions, and atmospheric pressure.
It helps users understand how climate differs across regions and how environmental factors interact with each other.

Objective:

To visually explore global weather behavior and uncover climate trends, supporting students, analysts, and researchers in understanding environmental changes through an interactive dashboard.

Key Insights:

The dashboard uncovers several important insights about global climate behavior. Temperature analysis reveals clear variations between regions, highlighting the hottest and coldest cities while also showing how countries differ in their average temperature levels. The distribution of weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, and foggy days helps identify dominant climate patterns across locations. Humidity and visibility patterns further indicate regions with high moisture levels or reduced visibility due to fog or pollution. Wind speed and atmospheric pressure visualizations provide meaningful clues about potential storm activity, as locations with strong winds often align with areas experiencing lower pressure. Correlation-based visuals such as Temperature vs. Humidity and Wind Speed vs. Pressure help explain how different environmental factors interact with one another. Overall, the dashboard presents a clear and comprehensive picture of global weather trends, enabling deeper understanding of climate behavior and its variations.

Dashboard Analysis:

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes global weather patterns using the Global Weather Repository Dataset. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of temperature variations, humidity levels, wind speeds, atmospheric pressure, visibility, and weather conditions across multiple countries and cities. The objective of this project is to visually understand worldwide climate behavior and identify trends, anomalies, and relationships among key environmental factors, enabling students, researchers, and analysts to interpret climate data effectively.

The dataset includes fields such as Location, Country, City, Latitude, Longitude, Date, Temperature (°C and °F), Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, Visibility, and Weather Condition. Using this data, the dashboard is organized into four pages. The Overview page offers global KPIs, top hottest and coldest cities, a weather condition distribution chart, and a world map that displays temperature and weather patterns geographically. The KPI & Summary page presents maximum and minimum climate values, average readings, and country-wise comparisons. The Trends page highlights time-series visualizations showing how temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure change over different dates, supported by slicers for dynamic filtering. The final Deep Analysis page includes comparative visuals such as temperature and humidity relationships, wind speed versus pressure analysis, country-wise temperature and humidity breakdowns, and a detailed tabular view of the dataset.

Throughout this project, Power BI Desktop and Power Query were used for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization. The dashboard emphasizes interactive analysis through slicers, hover tooltips, KPIs, maps, donut charts, stacked visuals, and scatter plots. Developing this project enhanced my understanding of data storytelling, environmental analytics, dashboard design, and climate interpretation, while demonstrating how real-world weather data can be transformed into meaningful insights.

Key Insights from Dashboard:

Temperature patterns vary significantly across regions.

High humidity regions are often coastal or tropical.

Strong correlation observed between pressure and wind speed, indicating storms.

Weather conditions (sunny/cloudy/rainy) contribute to visibility variations.

Cities reach drastically different temperature extremes.
